<p style="text-align: justify;">A rafting trip in the Grand Canyon is exciting, adventurous and very popular.&nbsp;Planning one of these trips begins with determining the type of trip to take: a commercial or non-commercial trip.&nbsp;Trade tours are guided by professionals, open to the public, and reservations are usually made a year or two in advance.&nbsp;Non-commercial tours are self-guided and also open to the public;&nbsp;however, a permit must first be obtained through a weighted lottery.&nbsp;It is important to note that rafting the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon is considered an exceptionally technical stretch of the river and should not be attempted by inexperienced rafters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chances of winning the lottery, which takes place each year in February, are weighted so that the odds are better for those who haven't recently been on a Grand Canyon rafting trip.&nbsp;If non-commercial travel is chosen, the next logical step is to apply for a permit, which requires a fee and can be done online.&nbsp;The primary applicant must be at least 18 years old at the time of application, release dates awarded through the weighted lottery are permanent and cannot be changed in any way, and winners have approximately five days to pay a non-refundable deposit, which can vary, but usually costs several hundred US dollars (USD).&nbsp;A final permit fee is also charged per person,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a commercial or professionally guided trip is chosen, the next step is to determine the duration of the trip. There are two options: a one day trip or a three to 18 day trip. A one-day Grand Canyon rafting trip can consist of a half day or a full day of rafting, where the group or individual chooses between whitewater and flatwater experiences. Trips of three to 18 days are operated through a commercial provider and include a wide range of excursions. There are more than a dozen of these companies in the Grand Canyon region, and selecting one is next on the agenda for those planning a professionally guided <a href="https://www.advantagegrandcanyon.com/">Grand Canyon rafting adventures</a> trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the type of trip is selected and a definite date is set, it's time to schedule a flight or other mode of transportation to the Grand Canyon area and determine what to bring.&nbsp;Vendors will provide all the essentials for those on a professionally guided trip, including rafts, gear, food and, in some cases, transportation to and from the launch site.&nbsp;Commercial and non-commercial rafters will need to bring appropriate clothing, footwear, sunscreen, toiletries, and hats.</p>
